<h2 align="center"> About me </h2>


- :computer: I am a C++ programmer with a year of experience. I develop for Windows using C++ 14 Standard and Visual Studio 2022.

- :video_game: I also have experience developing in Unreal Engine 5 (1 year). I have created several games and plugins.

  <summary>More about me</summary>

<br>

My journey into programming began with Unreal Engine 5. In total I have made three games:

- [**Lacertian world**](https://hd-owl.itch.io/lacertian-world) - My first game and my first experience creating something functional. Itâ€™s a platformer with combat, divided into multiple levels with new mechanics introduced gradually.

- [**T.A.N.K**](https://hd-owl.itch.io/tank) - The second game where I consolidated and improved the skills I gained in the first project. It's a top-down shooter with multiplayer mode and progression for levels.

- [**One winter evening**](https://hd-owl.itch.io/one-winter-evening) - The third and so far latest game. A small game made for a game jam, featuring a story, cutscenes and monologues (arguably my best game).

In addition, I created four plugins:

- [**Variable Storage**](https://hd-owl.itch.io/variable-storage), [**Equipment Information**](https://hd-owl.itch.io/equipment-information), [**Variables To Variables**](https://hd-owl.itch.io/variablestovariables) â€” These were my first experiences working with C++.

- [**Time Saving Actions**](https://hd-owl.itch.io/time-saving-actions) - Just an experiment.

As a result, C++ became more interesting to me than making games and plugins.

&emsp;I started studying standard C++ on my own. At first I followed a YouTube course to gain the basics, then I wrote small programs for friends. One day I decided to look for tools that could simplify routine tasks in games. Everything I found required writing scripts, so I thought: why not build such a tool myself? Iâ€™m probably not the only one with that need. Thatâ€™s how the idea for my first pet project â€” **ColorSeach** â€” was born.
